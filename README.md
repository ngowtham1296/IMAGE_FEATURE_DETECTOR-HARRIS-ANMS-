# **PROJECT TITLE: HARRIS DETECTOR AND ADAPTIVE NON MAXIMAL SUPPRESSION (ANMS)**The project mainly focusses on the feature detection on a input image using Harris detector and Adaptive non maximal suppression. To do this we need MATLAB software which is loaded with computer vision package. This project doesn&#39;t use any built in function. Two images were used for both the methods to study the comparison.**Getting Started:**1. **Prerequisites:**  - Image Processing techniques     1. Histogram of Image     2. Image Convolution     3. Gaussian kernel - Feature detection techniques     1. Harris Detector     2. Adaptive non maximal suppression -  MATLAB2. **Run:** - Download the input image from the github repository.     **Link:** [https://github.com/ngowtham1296/IMAGE\_FEATURE\_DETECTOR-HARRIS-ANMS/blob/master/bottle/box.bmp](https://github.com/ngowtham1296/IMAGE_FEATURE_DETECTOR-HARRIS-ANMS/blob/master/bottle/box.bmp) - Then run the main\_code.m file to perform the Harris detector and the adaptive non maximal suppression operation. - The results show the comparison between the two feature detectors. - After done with the first image download the second image from the github repository.     **Link:** [https://github.com/ngowtham1296/IMAGE\_FEATURE\_DETECTOR-HARRIS-ANMS-/blob/master/chequered/chessboard.png](https://github.com/ngowtham1296/IMAGE_FEATURE_DETECTOR-HARRIS-ANMS-/blob/master/chequered/chessboard.png) - This time run the main\_code1.m file to see the effects on the second image. - After getting the four results compare with each other to know the functions of each image feature detector.
